                        <p>At first this place was a beer garden in 1958. Then, the owner, Bon Smith, changed it to
                            hotel. He said that all these rooms and balcony must be in use. Also, he understood that
                            the parks and the malls around will be a location which people willn't want miss.</p>
                        <p>In the parks around you can find a castle, a river and unique trees. The malls around include
                            shops which you find only here. There are also food trucks. Come and join us!</p>

                            What a great hotel! We enjoyed every moment of our stay. 
                            The staff is kind, the location is excellent and the food is wonderful.
                            We recommend renting a car from the hotel and going for a walk around the area. 
                             There are more places to see. For example, the large forset, with all the rare animels live in it.
                        </p>

                            Amazing vacation. Food is excellent, location is close to all the important attractions and gym is
                             equipped with advanced machines. We bought in mall clothes for the whole year. Prices were good.
                             The hotel's staff recommended us the best shopes and resteraunts.
